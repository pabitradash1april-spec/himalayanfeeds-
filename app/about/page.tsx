              Himalayan Feeds began with a simple idea — that every farmer deserves
              feed that performs the same, bag after bag. Today we formulate and
              manufacture nutrition for poultry, fish, shrimp and dairy cattle,
              supplying a growing network of dealers across India.

              Our recipes are balanced by nutritionists and batch-tested at every
              stage of production. The result is antibiotic-free feed that improves
              feed conversion, supports animal health, and puts more value into
              every farm it reaches.
